Unlock the secrets hidden in binary code without needing the source! Written by a Linux kernel engineer and author with over 14 years of industry experience, this book lays a solid foundation in reverse engineering and takes you from curious analyst to expert. Youâ€™ll master advanced techniques to dissect kernel binaries, including kernel module files, vmlinux, and vmcore, giving you the power to analyze systems at their core.
This practical, three-part journey starts with the essentials of reverse engineering, introducing the key features of Armv8-A processors and the ELF file format. The second part walks you through the reverse-engineering process, from Arm environment setup to using static and dynamic analysis tools, including innovative methods for analyzing kernel binaries and the powerful debugging tool uftrace. The final part covers security, exploring TrustZone and the latest security techniques to safeguard Arm devices at the hardware level.
By the end of this reverse engineering book, you'll have comprehensive Armv8-A expertise and the practical skills to analyze any binary with confidence while leveraging advanced security features to harden your systems.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</h2></summary>

  To get the most benefit from this book, we recommend the following:

  - You should be familiar with using Linux, especially with the command-line interface (shell).
  - You should have basic knowledge of the C programming language.

  We have tested all the example code in this book using the following platforms:

  - x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as a guest OS (running on Oracle VirtualBox 7.0)
  - Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (64-bit Arm), tested with both the standard distribution kernel and our custom 6.6 kernel (lightly tested)
